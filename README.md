# procedural-generation



## SectionTrigger.cs

`SectionTrigger.cs` consists of a procedural generation script. To make it work, simply add the GameObject you want to generate in the Inspector panel. That's all!  

The rest of the files are related to **Color Dash**, a game similar to *Color Switch*.
